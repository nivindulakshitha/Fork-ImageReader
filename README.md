Image Reader (OCR) extension helps you easily get words out of any image. It uses an open-source OCR library called Tesseract. Tesseract.js is an open-source JavaScript library and is made via an Emscripten port of the famous Tesseract OCR Engine written in C and C++. Please visit (https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) to get more info.

To work with this add-on, simply open the addon's interface and load your image via the file selector (top section). A sample scenario is also included in the package to test the add-on (press on the "sample" button at the top toolbar). Before using the add-on, please make sure to select the appropriate OCR language. Default OCR language is set to English.

Note: this addon uses: "https://github.com/naptha/tessdata/tree/gh-pages/" GitHub repo in order to fetch language data required for the OCR operation. Language data packs are very large in size and cannot be included in the add-on package.
